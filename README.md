# Quantum_Blockchain

## Quantum-lattice BlockChain Structure
* Index
* Timestamp
* Data
* Quantum Key
* hash (lattice-based)


## Quantum Key Distribution ( based on BB92 protocol)
* Simulate BBM92 quantum key distribution protocol
* Creation of two quantum circuits named Alice and Bob
* Apply Hadamard gate on Alice's qubit, measure it, and share the circuit state with Bob
* Simulate circuits, compare results, and establish a secure key


## Latice Based Hash
* Take index, previous_hash, timestamp, data, quantum_key as input
* Calculate hash using lattice-based hash function 
* lattice-based hash function employs SHAKE-256 algorithm and large prime modulus for message digest and producing lattice-based hash using previous_hash

# The Test:
* We are implemting Double-Spending Attack on a simple blockchaina nd our proposed quantum blockchain and comparing the complexity of both the codes by looking at he outputs.
* The output clearly showcases that the more complex nature of the quantum blockcahin makes it harder for such an attack to be successful.
* This ensures the future safety of blockchain applications from the more sophisticated and fast Quantum Computers by utilizing quantum safe algorithms.
